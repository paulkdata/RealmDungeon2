# RealmDungeon 2
RealmDungeon 2 is a throwback to text-based MUDs and MMOs. The player assumes the role of a fan and citizen preservationist, logging into their favourite game to record events before the last servers are finally decommissioned.

Instructions:
- Navigate the map with North, South, East and West links
- Look for in-game events, which will play out in real time. Once the event is complete, you can click "Record" (if you have enough memory)
- Events only play once, so if you walk away from one before recording, it's gone forever!
- Think fast! You're on a timer! Sections of the map will become unavailable over time, starting from the very top.
- Click "Log out" when you're done, and admire the record you've created of your favourite game
